          About: Overview
        </h1>
        <p>
          The increasingly urban population around the globe will need more intelligent, integrated designs to make it’s cities more resilient to emergencies along transportation infrastructure, in neighborhoods, or in highly-trafficked public space. 
      Our goal is to develop an automated system to alert emergency medical services (EMS) the moment a car crash has occurred. The idea was inspired by the growing issue of traffic in Atlanta: every year more people move to the city, making our roadways more congested and making the interstate system near impossible to navigate during rush hours. Car crashes only compound this issue, and when lives are at stake as well, a more intelligent system is imperative.

        <p>
          We are currently working with the GDOT to begin putting units on the road, test their ability, and continue improvements. When we can deliver a technology, the GDOT is interested in investing in this infrastructure. We as well are applying to the SmartCity initiative which currently has given money to Columbus, Ohio, and will hopefully be able to develop our technology in this Government subsidized environment. With a success in either city, we can then begin moving into other cities or municipalities to build our tech. We engage people by showing how many lives we save and how much more efficient their EMS are. Given the policy background of the group as well as the technical background, we will have the ability to as well work out issues such as budgeting and applications for grants to make the process as seamless as possible.

          Team
        </h1>
        <p>
          Our team is comprised of 5 Georgia Tech students in the Computer Science, Electrical Engineering, Business and Public Policy departments. We have gained a lot of experience through individual internships (Microsoft, Cisco, General Electric), research projects (IoT, Audio Analysis, Data Storage) and leadership experience (Grand Challenges, Diversity Ambassadors, Greek Life, Robogals, Girls Who Code, Wreck Camp) that have been extremely helpful in our journey up to this point. We are a diverse group of people with strong leadership, networking, and technical backgrounds and even though we are just students in college we have the passion to do great things.

          Problem
        </h1>
        <p>
          The issue lies in the increasing stress on transportation infrastructure in American cities. People living in the city are seeing greater traffic in roadways and need revamped mass-transportation. In terms of customers, we’re seeing policymakers looking for solutions to the issues that plague their constituencies.

          Solution
        </h1>
        <p>
          Our automated system involves a network of physical vibration sensors that remotely detect the crash through machine-learned pattern recognition of the physical vibrations emitted in the event. The current solution is the 911 call: waiting for an onlooker to call and describe the location, situation, and severity of the crash. The response after the 911 call is almost as efficient as possible, and has been optimized thoroughly. A call can take five minutes, between the moment of the crash to the end of the call. Also if there are no onlookers the crash can go unreported. A minute on the I-75/I-85 connector in Atlanta costs the surrounding economy $7 million, and the impact per minute increases with each minute. As well, secondary crashes caused by the initial crash are common and more fatal than the initial crash.
